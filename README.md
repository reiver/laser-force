# Laser Force

**Laser Force** is a vintage toy-line from the 1980s.

## Corporation

**Laser Force** was created, by people, through the company which is today known as — **American Plastic Toys Inc.**

Although “**American Plastic Toys Inc.**” was not the company's original name.
The company's previously was named — **Gay Toys Inc.**

Why the name change‽ —

This is speculation, but the common meaning for the word “gay” used to be —

> gay (adjective): joyous, joyful, happy.

It was likely this is the meaning for the word “gay” that the previous company name (“**Gay Toys Inc.**”) was derived.

Most people nowadays aren't aware of this meaning for the word “gay”.
And would probably assume a company named “Gay Toys Inc.” makes sex toys (rather than children's toys) which could be why the company changed its name.
The company makes childrens' toys, and may not have wanted to connote anything sexual.
