# Laser Force

**Laser Force** is a vintage toy-line from the 1980s.

The **Laser Force** toy line consists of (toy) **vehicles** and **action figures** in the 3¾ inch scale.
Although the (toy) **vehicles** seemed to be the focus of the **Laser Force** toy line.

## Compatibility

Being in the 3¾ inch scale made **Laser Force** compatible with other 1980s era & 1970s area toy lines in the 3¾ inch scale; such as:

* **Adventure People** by Fisher Price _et al._,
* **A-Team** by Galoob  _et al._,
* **Black Hole** by Mego _et al._,
* **Buck Rogers** by Mego _et al._,
* **G.I. Joe** by Hasbro _et al._,
* **Metal-Man** by Zee Toys, Zylmex, _et al._,
* **Micronauts** by Mego _et al._,
* **Pocket Super Heroes** by Mego  _et al._,
* **Star Wars** by Kenner _et al._,
* etc.

And one can speculate that this may have been the intent of **Laser Force**'s creators.
That they were making (toy) **vehicles** to be used with other toy lines made by others.

## Corporation

**Laser Force** was created, by people, through the company which is today known as — **American Plastic Toys Inc.**

Although “**American Plastic Toys Inc.**” was not the company's original name.
The company's previously was named — **Gay Toys Inc.**

Why the name change‽ —

This is speculation, but the common meaning for the word “gay” used to be —

> gay (adjective): joyous, joyful, happy.

It was likely this is the meaning for the word “gay” that the previous company name (“**Gay Toys Inc.**”) was derived.

Most people nowadays aren't aware of this meaning for the word “gay”.
And would probably assume a company named “Gay Toys Inc.” makes sex toys (rather than children's toys) which could be why the company changed its name.
The company makes childrens' toys, and may not have wanted to connote anything sexual (as it violates common taboos in common contemporary North American culture).

**Laser Force** toys seemed to be released both when the company was called ‘**Gay Toys Inc.**’, and when the company was called ‘**American Plastic Toys Inc.**’.
